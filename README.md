# Assignment 0 Hello Web

This assignment challenges you to go through the HTML5, CSS/CSS3, and Javascript/JS tutorials and answer some quick Google questions. This material is effectively it's own course in CINS110, that was the pre-requisite to CINS465; however, as we've removed this course as a pre-requisite so you are responsible for learning HTML5, CSS, and JS mostly on your own. This material will be imperative to being successful in this class; however, it is will have minimal time in class as I'll mostly be using these tools in relation to the web framework used in this class.
