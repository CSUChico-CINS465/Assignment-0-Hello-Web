# Assignment 0 Hello Web

In order to be prepared for this class you will want to familiarize yourself with HTML5, CSS/CSS3, and Javascript/JS. This material was effectively it's own course in CINS110, that was the pre-requisite to CINS465; however, as we've removed this course as a pre-requisite so you are responsible for learning HTML5, CSS, and JS mostly on your own. This material will be imperative to being successful in this class; however, it is will have minimal time in class as I'll mostly be using these tools in relation to the web framework used in this class.
